In this small project, we were tasked to create multiple functions that broke a txt file. <b />
The txt file had two types of information following a simple pattern: Odd lines is a websites, and Even lines are data. <b />
This project focused on creating unique tokens that correlated to a certain website. <b />
Using the search engine function, you are then able to map those tokens to a website or multiple.
